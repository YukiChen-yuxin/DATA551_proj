# Features Implemented
Our dashboard is spread across 3 pages of content. It had a slide bar with an introduction of the project and group members. There are three navbars which can go to different pages.

## Page 1
* Shows count of homicides in the US by States, and presents the data according to the gender of the victim and the perpetrator
* Can filter the count of homicides across year values and the year slider can be controller two ways
* Can filter weapon type values and there is a selected-all checkbox to select all weapons
* By selecting a state, shows line chart and bar chart about counts of homicides by month and by perpetrator race
* The page accomplishes a relatively good level of interactivity, by selecting different continents, all three graphs change accordingly

## Page 2
* Shows count of homicides in the US across months
* Can filter this count of homicides across 3 column values: homicide across months for each US state, weapon type, relationship type

## Page 3
* Use the Sankey plot to show the count of records for different sexes and races of perpetrators corresponding to different sexes and races of victims
* Can filter the data across year values and the yeat slider can be controller two ways

# Features To Improve On

## Page 1 & 2 & 3
* The ability to select multiple states at once could be added to the map


# Some thoughts

Our dashboard development process involved ensuring that each graph and selector was clearly labelled with a description of its purpose and the relationship of the data within the graph. This was crucial in ensuring that users could easily understand the meaning behind each visualization and selector without any confusion. Additionally, the consistent styling between pages helped maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the dashboard.

The feedback received from the teaching assistant and users was valuable in improving the usability of the dashboard. The suggestion to change the year slider to a two-way slider made it easier for users to select a range of years. Adding a "selected all" checkbox for weapon selection helped improve the selection process, allowing users to quickly and easily select all the available options.

During the development process, linking each page together using different py files helped streamline the modification process. This helped isolate issues and pinpoint specific areas for improvement. The addition of cards to the dashboard layout also helped to enhance the visual appearance of the dashboard, making it more appealing and user-friendly.

Overall, the development of the dashboard was a collaborative effort that involved incorporating user feedback, making changes, and refining the design to create a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard.

Developing dashboards not only serves as a useful tool for presenting data in a clear and concise manner, but it also provides an opportunity for us to improve our skills in all aspects, including design and coding skills.

When designing a dashboard, it is important to consider the overall aesthetics of the platform. Designing the layout of the dashboard to be intuitive and easy to navigate is crucial to its success.

In terms of coding, we are required to retrieve features and adapt our code according to feedback. By doing so, we are able to strengthen our coding skills and become more adept at problem-solving.

Developing dashboards also provides a valuable opportunity to work with data and visualize it in meaningful ways. This allows us to better understand the data and the insights that can be gleaned from it. Through the process of creating a dashboard, we are able to hone our data analysis skills and become more proficient in data visualization techniques.
